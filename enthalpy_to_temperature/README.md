This folder contains the evaluation of enthalpy to temperature conversion methods. It is only present in the current branch because it motivates the implementation choices regarding enthalpy-to-temperature conversion.

In particular, this folder contains the following files:
- _enthalpy2temperature.ipynb_: describes the approach and presents the results for _lead_;
- _lbe_results.ipynb_: presents the results for _LBE_;
- _bismuth_results.ipynb_: presents the results for _bismuth_;
- _nak_results.ipynb_: presents the results for _NaK_;
- _sodium_results.ipynb_: presents the results for _sodium_.

The folder also contains the _data_ subfolder, where tables for interpolation are stored.
